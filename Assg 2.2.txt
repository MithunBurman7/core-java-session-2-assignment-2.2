Difference between Compiler and Interpreter.

Compiler :-
	                                                  
1.Compiler takes entire program as input.	          
2.Intermediate object code is generated.	           
3.Conditional control statements are executes faster.	
4.More memory requires(Since Object Code is Generated).	
5.Program need not be compiled every time.	                
6.Errors are displayed after entire program is checked.	                                          



Interpreter :-

1.Interpreter takes single instruction as input .
2.No intermediate object code is generated.
3.Conditional control statements are executes slower.
4.Less momery requires.
5.Every time higher level program is converted into lower level program.
6.Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted (if any).
